You have two options for deploying Angular packages: npm.org and GitHub Packages. Here’s how to deploy to both:

Deploy to npm.org
Login to npm:

First, ensure you are logged into npm. If you don’t have an npm account, create one here.
bash
    npm login
Enter your credentials (username, password, and email) when prompted.

Configure your package.json:

Update the package.json file of your Angular package with the following fields:
json
{
  "name": "@your-username/package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your package description",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git"
  },
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
  }
}
Publish your package to npm:

Once your package.json is ready and you're logged into npm, run the following command to publish:
bash
npm publish --access public
(Use --access public to publish a public package. For private packages, omit this flag.)

Verify your package:

After publishing, go to npm.org to confirm that your package appears in your profile.


If you generated an npm access token, you can use that instead of logging in with your username and password. Here's how you can configure npm to use your access token:

Step 1: Add the Access Token to npm
If you haven’t already configured your npm to use the token, follow these steps:

Open your terminal and run the following command to add your token to the npm config:

bash
npm set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with the actual token you generated in your npm account.

Verify that the token has been added by running:

bash
npm config get //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken
Step 2: Publish the Package
Once the access token is configured, you should be able to publish your package without logging in:

bash

npm publish --access public

Deploy to GitHub Packages
Authenticate with GitHub Packages:

You’ll need a GitHub token with the read:packages, write:packages, and repo scopes. Create a personal access token.
Configure npm to use GitHub Packages:

Set up authentication by running the following command, replacing <TOKEN> with your GitHub personal access token:
bash
npm set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<TOKEN>
Update your package.json:

Add your GitHub Package registry and adjust the name field to include your GitHub username:
json
{
  "name": "@your-github-username/package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your package description",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git"
  },
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
  }
}
Publish to GitHub Packages:

Once your package.json is ready, publish the package using the following command:
bash
npm publish
Verify the package:

Go to your repository in GitHub and navigate to the "Packages" section to confirm your package is published.
